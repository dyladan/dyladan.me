Tiling Window Managers
======================

Recently I have taken it upon myself to try DWM. I have been happily using i3
for quite a while now but I have always kept DWM in the back of my mind as an
eventual interest. When I first started using tiling window managers, DWM
seemed daunting and scary. One of the stated project goals on their website is
to keep the userbase "small and elitist" so as not to have newbies crying about
their problems in the message boards, so I went with i3.

i3 Window Manager
-----------------

I don't really remember most of my setup process for i3, but that's probably a
good thing. It mostly consisted of copy pasting snippets of configurations from
other people's blogs to make it a little more pleasing on the eyes (i3 is
pretty ugly out of the box), and some simple configurations for my shortcuts.


- i3 super configurable
  - this can be good but also bad (string cheese code)
- i3 very batteries included
- long lost configs that may or may not do anything
