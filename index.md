Welcome to my website. Not everthing on this site is completely finished,
including the site itself. What follows is a list of things I've been
working on. Some of them are well thought out, others not so much.
I try to only post things that are somewhat complete thoughts here, but
if you want to see some of my works in progress feel free to browse my github.
Interesting technical note: all content is loaded from static markdown files.
To view the markdown for any file, just remove the "#" from the URL.
